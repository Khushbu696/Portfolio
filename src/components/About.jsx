                        Hi, I’m <strong>Khushbu Patel</strong>, a passionate Computer Science
                        and Engineering student who loves creating modern, interactive, and
                        user-friendly applications. I enjoy blending creativity with logical
                        problem-solving, whether it's building games, crafting engaging
                        websites, or designing innovative solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My work often combines <strong>technology</strong>,{" "}
                        <strong>design</strong>, and <strong>storytelling</strong>. I’m always
                        exploring new tools, experimenting with UI/UX concepts like
                        neumorphism, and expanding my skills to bring ideas to life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside coding, I love exploring natural landscapes, reading sci-fi
                        novels, and listening to music that matches my mood.
